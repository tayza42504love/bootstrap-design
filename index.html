                                Mount Popa is an ancient extinct volcano located in Mandalay region in Myanmar.
                            </p>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>It is a sacred pilgrimage site for the Burmese who visit the 37 temples dedicated to Mahagiri Nat spirits worshipped by the people. Mount Popa is one of the excellent day trip options for tourists exploring Bagan as it is located 50km from its old town.
                                    The most popular among these pagodas lined up around the mountain is Taung Kalat, which is home to Goddess Popa, located at the neck of the hill. It is accessed by climbing about 777 steps leading to the top. The temples consist of Nat statues enshrined within cave-like structures, which are at the foot of Taung Kalat. The main pagoda at the summit was built in the 17th century when Kings practised spirit-worship. The hike to the top takes about 45 minutes. 
                                    Wear clothes covering your knees and shoulders. You need to keep your shoes at the foot of the temple. Beware of large groups of aggressive monkeys on the way to the top, which are infamous for snatching all things from tourists. For best panoramic views, climb to the top of Mount Popa around sunrise or during the sunset.
